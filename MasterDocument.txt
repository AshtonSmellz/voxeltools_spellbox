AI Prompt:
I want to make a game functionally similar to minecraft, but I want the main progression of the game to rely on crafting and combining 
new magical ingredients that can have different influences on physical properties within the world. For example, a player could craft a 
spell with a spherical emitter that decreases the friction of all blocks found within the target emitter. As a result, I need to store 
additional physical properties in every block such as friction, temperature, gravity strength, etc. Some of these properties dont 
need to be stored on a per block basis, and can instead be affiliated with an ID, like the specific heat of a block, or its conductivity. 
I need you to look over the existing project, and create a thorough, but brief document detailing the function of every script that
is already in the project. This is needed so that we can reference that document later and not accidentally overwrite, or break
prexisting work.
